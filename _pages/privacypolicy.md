# Privacy Policy

Thank you for using Pump. We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy.

This document outlines our stance on privacy for Pump, what data we collect, and how we use it.

<br>

## Data We Collect

When you use Pump to track your workouts, you enter routine, exercise, and workout data. This will only be stored locally on your device and is completely anonymous. If you delete Pump, all workout data will be permanently removed from your device. This information is stored to fulfil the service that Pump sets out to provide.

App settings, such as your preference on colour scheme and feature visibility, are stored in the same way and permanently removed when you delete Pump.

If you enable Apple Health integration, Pump can share your workouts with Apple Health based on the permissions you grant. Pump can only read workouts that it has written to Apple Health and cannot read any other Health data. This is done solely to keep them in sync when you edit or delete them within Pump.

If you email [feedback.pump@gmail.com](mailto:feedback.pump@gmail.com) for support, you may share personally identifiable information with us, such as your email address and debug information. We retain any information received only as long as necessary to support your query and improve our customer service. The contents of any email you send will not be shared and we will never send you unsolicited emails.
